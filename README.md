# Keita: A PyTorch Toolkit

## Description

A couple of utilities, dataset loaders, and layers compiled and created by me which I believe everyone should have access to.

Noticed that I've been writing way too many boilerplate code for my work and personal projects, so feel free to check out or utilize any of my code here.

I cannot guarantee fixing any bugs whatsoever; though if you have any you'd like to report then let me know. Feedback definitely is appreciated though!

Biggest thing I must note though is that I care a lot and tend to refrain from using large libraries of code. I intend to make the code as clean as possible, and keep the code style consistent and developer-friendly.

## Dependencies

PyTorch, Torchvision, and the bleeding edge build version of TorchText are needed to use this library.

## Contents

- Mahalanobis-based metric loss for deep metric learning.
- Dot-product inter-attention for bidirectional RNN models.
- 2D separable convolution.
