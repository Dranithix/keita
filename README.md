# Keita: A PyTorch Toolkit

## Description

A couple of utilities, dataset loaders, and layers compiled and created by me which I believe everyone should have access to.

Noticed that I've been writing way too many boilerplate code for my work and personal projects, so feel free to check out or utilize any of my code here.

I cannot guarantee fixing any bugs whatsoever; though if you have any you'd like to report then let me know. Feedback definitely is appreciated though!

## Dependencies

PyTorch, Torchvision, and Torchtext are needed.
